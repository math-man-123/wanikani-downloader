## Introduction
This project is part of my [personal website](http://philsfun.com) (currently not populated) and can be reached [here](http://philsfun.com/wanikani). It is intendet as a way to improve your WaniKani study by allowing you to download WaniKani content as Anki cards. The project is a continuation of my previous project [wanikani-recent-mistakes](https://github.com/math-man-123/wanikani-recent-mistakes) even though that exact feature is currently still missing.

## Features
Firstly you can simply view content from any level or srs-stage (e.g. your apprentice items). The view can be filtered by type (radical, kanji, vocabulary) and provides clickable cards linking to their corresponding WaniKani site.

Secondly you can download 3 types of decks from your selected content: Basic (the same as WaniKani), Reversed (instead of 木 -> 'tree' you go 'tree' -> 木), Writing (practise handwriting radicals and kanjis). The Anki cards contain all immediatly usefull information like meanings, readings, mnemonics, but also link back to the WaniKani site for further info.
