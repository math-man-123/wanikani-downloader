## Introduction
This project is part of my [personal website](http://philsfun.com) (currently not populated) and can be reached [here](http://philsfun.com/wanikani). It is intendet as a way to improve your WaniKani study by allowing you to download WaniKani content as Anki cards. The project is a continuation of my previous project [wanikani-recent-mistakes](https://github.com/math-man-123/wanikani-recent-mistakes) even though that exact feature is currently still missing.

## Features
Firstly you can simply view content from any level or srs-stage (e.g. your burned items). The view can be filtered by type (radical, kanji, vocabulary) and provides clickable cards linking to their corresponding WaniKani site.
