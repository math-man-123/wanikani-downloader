## Introduction
This project is part of my [personal website](https://philsfun.com) (currently not populated) and can be reached [here](https://philsfun.com/wanikani). It is intendet as a way to improve your WaniKani study by allowing you to download WaniKani content as Anki cards. The project is a continuation of my previous project [wanikani-recent-mistakes](https://github.com/math-man-123/wanikani-recent-mistakes) even though that exact feature is currently still missing.
